# algorithms and data structures

## why?

50%+ of performance gains have been from algorithmic improvements vs. hardware

algorithms
  study of "problems", creating solutions, analyzing solutions

## algorithmic complexity

"problems"
   min / max
   sum
   average
   merge
   sorting
   shuffle
   shortest path
   traveling salesman
   knapsack
   hashing
   text search
   compression
   matrix multiplication
   clicking / collision detection


care about...
  time complexity
  space complexity
  ...parallelization (more recent)
     (ie. b/c we have GPUs and multi-core CPUs, a solution may be better if it can be parallelized)

SEARCH (given sorted list of length n, find x)
 - naive O(n)
 - binary O(log n)

complexity
 - typically concerned w/ time & memory as functions of input length
 - worst, best, average case
 - "big O"
    - worst case at large N
    - can ignore all terms but the 'highest order'
    - order: c root(n)  logn nlogn n^2 n^3 c^n n!

SORT (given unsorted list of length n, sort it)
 - naive O(n^2)
 - merge sort O(n log n)
   - merge sort is an example of divide and conquer
 - animations: http://www.sorting-algorithms.com/
 - nlogn is best we can do for 'comparison' sorts
 - other sorts (bucket, radix) can do better if we know something about the data

divide & conquer
 - a useful approach in solving many problems
 - approach:
    1. split problem into pieces (usually half) and call our function on the halves
    2. need to handle base case
    3. need to handle 'merging'
 - ex. binary search, merge sort

 FIBONACCI
  - recursive, naive O(2^n)
  - recursive, memoized O(n)
  - closed form solution O(c)

dynamic programming
  =~ recursion + memoization


algorithms
  quicksort
  map/reduce
  monte-carlo
  simulated-annealing
  breadth-first-search / depth-first-search
  A*

data structures
  binary tree
  quad-tree


complexity classes
  P - solvable in poly time
  NP - provable in poly time

  provable and solveable are different problems
    ex. comparison sort is nlogn, proving it is n
  it's and open question whether P=NP (ie. if a problem is proveable in poly time, does it mean there is a solution to it in poly time)
